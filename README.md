- [ ] Remove unused text and references from manuscript
- [ ] Remove unused figures
- [ ] Rename figure folders after their in-text reference
- [ ] Replace this text by final text and build instructions
- [ ] Uniform subfigure handling; use sans typeface for A, B, ...
- [ ] Address definition 1: r-Hamming matching
- [ ] Address complaint that symbols are used before their definition
- [ ] Fix typoes
- [ ] Let `waga` and `1+1ea` read and convert a DIMACS file for CNF problems instead 
- [ ] Improve fig. 2 clarity somehow, addressing a complaint
- [ ] Improve fig. 5 look; smaller dots and adjust linesize
- [ ] Add r-contiguous automaton illustration
- [ ] Add scaling wrt naive implementation result
- [X] Address complaint of large figure causing PDF to render slowly
